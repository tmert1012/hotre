hotmail random engine

Many moons ago, in 2007, in the dusty wild west of promotional email marketing, the hotmail random engine was born.

At the time email filtering or spam filtering, was based mostly on where an email originated, ip reputation and technical correctness of a sending domain name and/or mail server. Hotmail was one of the first, that we noticed, were successfully blocking/bouncing/spam foldering based on the email content. It seemed that the content filtering could learn or at least had thresholds. This meant that some messages of the same campaign (email send based on list) could at first land in the inbox, then some a few minuntes in the spam folder, then finally the rest as a soft or hard bounce.

We noticed from email seeding that our competitors were creating "randoms" which was the latest way to try to improve inbox success with content filters. Randoms were for the most part broken HTML or junk content that was included in the message in such a way to remain hidden or out of view yet make the message look less promotional and more personal or unique.

HotRE was a system to create random content for Hotmail. HotRE would create randomes, conduct test mailings in the early hours, measure inbox/spam box success rates and report back successful "randoms" that could be used for that day's campaigns. Example randoms were broken HTML, CSS, random content scraped from public websites and even natural language generation.

The system performed well technically and on a daily basis provided randoms that regularly penetrated the spam folder. Suprisingly, this was a win, since at the time at least, people often checked and clicked on spam messages. The project never achieved real "inbox" success, and I think this was mostly beacuse the randoms were almost entirely recycled ideas from competitors. Had more time been spent on creating original randoms, I think "inbox" success would have been achieved.

The style of promotional email marketing descibed above has gone the way of the dinosaur. Basically all email servers today are very good at sniffing and sorting out any spam-like messages. This code is no longer maintained and probably does not work in the current state. To try to use this to send in the manner which it was originally developed would be a total waste of time. Email marketing simply isn't what it used to be, in the good ol' days.

This project was added for posterity and to show an interesting project in the early days of promtional email marketing.
