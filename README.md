hotmail random engine

Many moons ago, in 2007, in the dusty wild west of promotional email marketing, the hotmail random engine was born.

Revenue was not consistent for our hotmail sends. Revenue was either great or none at all on a per day, per DH basis.

Investigate how to more optimally send hotmail, make better use of our dedicated hotmail servers and make more revenue from out hotmail lists. 

Study what was working for us and competitors. After finding that mailing with “randoms” or hidden HTML data, increased the inbox success, I built a system to create random content, conduct test mailings and measure inbox/spam box success rates.

The system performed well technically and on a daily basis provided our content team with working “randoms” that regularly penetrated the spam box and increased hotmail revenue.
